# Visual Identity & Design System (v3.0)

## 1. Design Aesthetics: "The Premium Cognitive Prosthesis"

The interface must feel **alive, responsive, and state-of-the-art**. The goal is a stunning first impression that motivates focus.

- **Vibe:** Sleek Dark Mode (Glassmorphism based).
- **Typography:** Modern Sans-Serif (e.g., Inter, Outfit, or Sora) from Google Fonts.
- **Interactions:** Micro-animations for every action (Pomodoro start, task completion, audio recording pulse).

## 2. Color Palette (Human & LLM Friendly)

| Token                 | Hex/Value                   | Usage                                    |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Deep Background**   | `#0D0D0E`                   | Base for Dark Mode                       |
| **Glass Surface**     | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)` | Card backgrounds, modals                 |
| **Focus Primary**     | `#A855F7` (Purple)          | Primary buttons, active Pomodoro state   |
| **Focus Glow**        | `#C084FC`                   | Accent lines, hover states               |
| **Task Ready**        | `#22C55E` (Green)           | Completed tasks, successful transactions |
| **Cognitive Warning** | `#EAB308` (Yellow)          | AI Budget warnings, critical reminders   |
| **Text Primary**      | `#F9FAFB`                   | Headings, core information               |
| **Text Muted**        | `#9CA3AF`                   | Supporting text, metadata                |

## 3. UI Components & UX Guidelines

### A. The Audio Button

- **State Recording:** Central pulse animation (vibrant gradient).
- **State Processing:** Spinner with "Gemini 3 Thinking..." status.
- **Transition:** Audio wave visualization during capture.

### B. Glassmorphic Containers

- Every panel should have a `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`.
- Subtle borders (`1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`) to define edges without heavy shadows.

### C. Zero-Knowledge "Secure Lock" Indicator

- A small icon near the Gemini Key input showing its "Encrypted-on-Client" status.
- Tooltips explaining the Zero-Knowledge nature to "Tech Users".
