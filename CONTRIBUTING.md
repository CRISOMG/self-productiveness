# Contributing to Yourfocus

Thank you for your interest in Yourfocus!

## 🚧 Project Status

Yourfocus is currently in its **MVP phase**. As a project with commercial aspirations, we are maintaining a "Source Available" model under the **BSL 1.1 license**.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

Currently, we are not accepting external pull requests for the core product until we formalize our market position. However:

- **Feedback**: Feel free to open issues for bugs or feature suggestions.
- **Portofolio / Educational**: You are welcome to fork the project to study the architecture, but remember the commercial restrictions outlined in the [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## 📅 Roadmap

After our official launch, we plan to open up specific modules for community contribution. Stay tuned!
